## Abstract

## Motivation

In the ongoing debate of NFT royalties, advocates extoll how beneficial royalties are for an NFT ecosystem’s organic growth but detractors assert that royalties are exploitative and unnecessary. The reason why this debate arises is because the existing royalty structure is expressed as a rate (specified by the creator) of the sale price (hereinafter referred to as “fixed-rate royalty fee) and levied in the event of exchange of hands of the underlying NFT. This results in a misalignment of interests between the creator and the holder.

Cons of fixed-rate royalties:

it increases friction in transactions: the royalties paid by the holder is actually included in the sale price and higher royalty fees result in higher sale prices but less buyers.

the royalties paid to creators are unfair and extractive for holders, especially in a bear market where the NFT sale proceeds upon deduction of royalty fees may be even lower than the original purchase price.

On the flipside, removing royalties would hurt the very artists and creators who first turned to NFTs as a more profitable medium of selling their work. It’s not beneficial for the NFT ecosystem in the long run. Hence, here at [Hunter Club], we believe a hybrid approach, which aligns the interest of both the creator and the holder, is the solution.
